### Views
- HTML preview for template text (open `grammar.tem.md` and then press the _Open Preview_ icon in the editor or context menu)

### Quick Fixes

- Add a variable to the template model if an undeclared variable is used in `grammar.tem.md`. _Note that the `model.cto` file must be open for the quick fix to be available._
